This is the whole Release System:


Autodoc Automatically generated documentation using the deptree util 
	under the utils dir.  Useful for determining what functions are 
	called in a specific function. (though not entirely accurate)
Docs
	The HTML documentation thus far. Not complete of course, but I
	hope better than nothing.

IMS-ReleaseMgr
	The Perl5 library of common code
	Also contains oracle schema and tools under /misc

devmgr
	The client-side (developer) tools


rlsmgr
	The server-side (release manager) tools

utils
	Misc utils related to release manager
	Includes sysmonitor utility to monitor uptime of processes and URLS

Additional notes:

IMS::DBConnect::GetDBConnect is a method to connect to oracle.
Replace any of these calls with a standard DBI->connect call.
