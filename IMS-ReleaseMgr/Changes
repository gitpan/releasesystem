Revision history for Perl extension IMS::ReleaseMgr.

0.01  Thu Mar 12 16:39:13 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

	Coding completed Tue Mar 17 14:46:06 PST 1998, entered testing

0.1   Tue Mar 24 17:07:20 PST 1998
	- version number changed to 0.1 for first main internal release.

	Documentation added as POD.

0.3   Fri May 29 18:30:19 PDT 1998
	- I spaced out documenting whatever comprised 0.2

	Signature.pm module, database support in Utils.pm as well as file
	support.

	Signature module supports the CRC that www.hp.com uses as well as an
	MD5-based approach for IMSS machines.

	Added misc/make_tables.sql SQL script, since any machine that has
	to worry about database support will have also needed this package.

0.5   Mon Jul 13 18:02:14 PDT 1998
	- 0.4 only used in limited degrees as band-aid patch

	FileUtils.pm module added for users like IWC who need to be able to
	effect uploads and still have them mirrored, from within an app.

	Some code cleanup.

1.5   Tue Feb 23 15:50:02 PST 1999
	- No telling what I've forgotten to document up until now

	Some cleanup and bugfixes. IMS::ReleaseMgr no longer generates MD5
	sums at all, since that is kind of silly to generate it on the same
	machine that will be validating it. More stuff in
	IMS::ReleaseMgr::Utils, and added IMS::ReleaseMgr::Transfer to
	encapsulate the HTTP/FTP uploading.
