This directory holds sample configuration files.

My recommendation is to develop a tool that, run on the client side,
generates these files for all hosts in the mirror-pool database. The function
and structure of the files needs to include:

* Be named for the virtual host it represents (e.g. www.host.com)

* Be runnable by the sysmonitord tool to restart a "missing" daemon

* Be invocation-selectable as to whether the daemon that gets started reads
  configuration from the file or directly from DBI (the current scripts don't
  do this yet, either).

* Be written in a way (probably Bourne shell code) that allows the parameter
  key/value pairs to be written as "KEY=VALUE", while nothing else in the
  file matches that pattern. This allows the file to double as a config file
  for hosts that lack DBMS access, or for cases where the use of a config
  file is simply preferred. See the existing config files for an illustration
  of this.

This will be much easier than it sounds from the description above. Fetching
the entire mirror pool table is already an API call, and the rest of the
script's body is basically the same from one host to the next, differing only
in the hostname itself.
