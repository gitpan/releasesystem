This is the server-side component of the HTTP/WWW package release management
system. See also the IMS::ReleaseMgr package and the devmgr package.

Five tools are provided here:

rlsmgrd		A daemon process that monitors a specified repository dir
		for newly-arrived packages. Packages are passed off to the
		deploy tool for handling. rlsmgrd monitors the child process
		and also ensures that limits to the number of concurrent
		children are honored.

deploy_content	Manages the verification of the data, calls the command to
		deploy it locally, and effects the mirroring of the data,
		if such is appropriate.

process_content	Called by the deploy tool to actually move the files around
		into the proper HTTP server directories. Uses very minimal
		amount of configuration information and executes within the
		staging directory for the package.

roll_rm_logs	A tool that can be set up in cron to rotate the logs on a
		reasonable basis.

upload.pl	A CGI application that permits uploading of packages from a
		browser, and uses the mirror configurations to deduce where
		to leave the packages. Requires the upload.dat file in the
		same directory, and should be protected with HTTP access
		control. This tool is installed into the same directory as
		the other tools. It is up to the installer whether to copy
		it to the individual cgi-bin areas (assuming you have more
		than one virtual host on the physical host) or simply create
		symbolic links.

Somewhere around 7/9/99 I decided to drop the files in the conf/ directory
from the package. They're out of date, and the maturity of the DBI code in
the IMS::ReleaseMgr package is such that none of the rlsmgrd instances out
in production should be using config files, anyway. See the ToDo file for
more details on my unrealized goals.
