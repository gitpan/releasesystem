            Complete. All server-side functionality is currently in place.
            The remaining library call in the Lib/API component does not
            affect this component (though it will be used here, in the planned
            next generation). This has been in stable deployment for over 6
            months. No new work is expected until after the initial stable
            deployment of the entire system as a whole, including the
            development of the supplemental documentation.

            There are three primary branches of this component: a
            <I>CVS Command Wrapper</I>, the <I>Developer Management Tools</I>
            and the <I>Path/URL Translation Engine</I>. Of these
            three:
            <DL>
              <DT><B>CVS Command Wrapper</B></DT>
              <DD>
                Complete.
              </DD>
              <DT><B>Developer Management Tools</B></DT>
              <DD>
                <FONT COLOR=red>95% Complete</FONT>.
                The coding is complete. The FTP support is written and
		fit into the tool, but still needs testing.
              </DD>
              <DT><B>Path/URL Translator</B></DT>
              <DD>
                <FONT COLOR=red>Not started</FONT>.
                Certain points regarding the design are still being
                finalized. The existing wrapper is functional, though slow
                and difficult to maintain. Work will commence after that
                last parts are done on the <TT>release</TT> tool. Given
                that, a rough estimate places this at
                <FONT COLOR=red>2 weeks to develop</FONT> and
                <FONT COLOR=red>1 week for testing</FONT>.
              </DD>
            </DL>
            <br>
            Besides these, there is a requirement for a command-line to that
            would allow batch-mode release of small numbers of files, to
            assist projects that use nightly jobs to generate semi-static
            content from databases. This tool is still under consideration.

          <TD>
            Not started. Requires completion of both Server Side and Client
            Side. Current estimate is for
            <FONT COLOR=red>two documents</FONT>, tentative topics
            of "System Setup and Administration" and "User Manual and
            Process Guide". Approximately
            <FONT COLOR=red>one week for development of initial draft of each (two weeks total)</FONT>.
            An additional
            <FONT COLOR=red>4-5 days for gathering of proofreading feedback and making corrections and clarifications</FONT>
            is also expected.
            The first document completed can overlay the majority of
            proofreading with the development of the second document. All
            told, expect this component to need
            <FONT COLOR=red>3-4 weeks, or simply one month, to complete</FONT>.
