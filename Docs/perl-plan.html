              In addition to the changes between Perl 5.004_04 and 5.005,
              this upgrade will mark the removal of the AT&amp;T Sfio package
              from the Perl environment. Because of this, the upgrade will
              have to be handled carefully. However, there will likely be
              an improvement in performance associated with the upgrade as
              a result.

    <P>
      The version of the Perl interpreter currently in use on all ATG machines
      is 5.004, maintenance patch 4 (hereafter referred to as "5.004_04") with
      the AT&amp;T Sfio package linked in to support FastCGI. However, the most
      current version of Perl considered to be stable is 5.005, maintenance
      patch 3 ("5.005_03") which addresses a large number of bugs and offers
      improvements in several areas (including, but not limited to:
      documentation, thread support, regression test suite enhancements). On
      some platforms, progress is being hindered by the lack of some of these
      features and/or fixes (such as a need for threads on HPUX 11 for the
      sake of packages such as DBD::Oracle).
    </P>
    <H2><A NAME="steps">2. Necessary Steps and Considerations</A></H2>
    <P>
      The upgrade cannot simply be done across all machines without care and
      attention to several existing issues related to Perl and its deployment
      within ATG.
    </P>
    <H3>2.1. Stabilizing for future upgrade efforts</H3>
    <P>
      First and foremost, this upgrade effort should be a vehicle for
      stabilizing the process of installing, maintaining and upgrading Perl
      within ATG. Currently, each machine within the sphere of ATG control
      is updated separately. Despite progress made in the area of centralizing
      the effort of initial Perl deployment (in the form of ready-to-deploy
      <B>tar</B>-style archive files), once a machine is set up there is no
      further synchronization of upgrades to either the core Perl distribution
      or the additional extensions and modules deployed and used by ATG.
    </P>
    <P>
      To begin with, it is necessary to identify the variables involved in
      defining machine architectures as they impact the Perl upgrade. These
      are:
    </P>
    <DIV ALIGN="center">
      <table border=1 cellpadding=4>
        <tr>
          <th>Variable</th>
          <th>Possible Values</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Chip set</td>
          <td>PA-RISC 1.1, PA-RISC 2.0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>OS Version</td>
          <td>HPUX 10.X, HPUX 11.X</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </DIV>
    <P>
      Given this, there are only 4 possible combinations. Besides that, not
      all combinations may be in use. The only HPUX 11.X machine currently in
      the support pool is a PA2.0 machine, thus there is no current need
      for support for PA1.1 on 11.X. Indeed, it is possible to support HPUX
      10.X without regard to chip set issues due to backwards-compatibility.
      It is better however to provide the Perl environment as optimized as
      possible for the target machine.
    </P>
    <P>
      The proposal, then, is that a specific machine be designated as the
      build/test host for each chip/OS combination that requires support.
      Said machines will not need to be set aside exclusively for this purpose;
      at least two of the combinations can be supported using the existing
      hosts <B>i2496ds4</B> (HPUX 10.X on PA2.0) and <B>i2496ds6</B> (HPUX
      11.X on PA2.0). Using the designated machines, complete distributions
      of Perl and the requisite modules can be installed and then archived
      with the <B>tar</B> command. Updates to either the Perl core or to
      extra modules should be restricted to these build machines, and updates
      made to other machines (in particular the servers outside the corporate
      firewall) made only when enough has changed from the existing deployment
      version to warrant it and then to all machines at the same time. Updates
      for such issues as addressing critical bugs in modules would also be
      done across the boards, hopefully lessening the chance of a critical
      update being overlooked on a less-visible server.
    </P>
    <P>
      If this is implemented, it will provide the following additional
      benefits:
      <UL>
        <LI>
          Specific installations can be marked either by date or with an
          internal version number. A simple (possibly auto-generated) utility
          script can accompany a distribution to identify the version and
          build host. This would greatly aid in troubleshooting problems
          suspected of being Perl-related.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Production servers (those beyond the corporate firewall) will no
          longer need the full suite of developer tools (C compiler, etc.)
          to facilitate the build and installation of Perl.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Keeping the extensive list of CPAN modules used by ATG's Perl
          installation would become more centralized, as would keeping all
          supported sites syncronized.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Besides the CPAN modules, there are several in-house Perl components
          that are needed on each host. These lack a centralized location and
          are generally not as easy to install as the CPAN modules.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Devising a method for seamless updating of Perl would be much
          easier with such a stable base to start from. At present, it is
          often difficult to update Perl itself or certain of the modules
          due to the binaries being resident in memory. On most machines,
          Perl is essentially permanently resident due to daemon processes
          such as the <B><TT>sysmonitord</TT></B> and <B><TT>rlsmgrd</TT></B>
          tools.
        </LI>
      </UL>
    </P>
    <H3>2.2. Removal of the sfio package</H3>
    <P>
      The other significant window of opportunity brought on by the upgrade
      of Perl is the phasing-out of the AT&amp;T Sfio (Safe/Fast IO) package.
      This library had been in use in order to support the <I>FastCGI</I>
      plug-in for Netscape. Recent versions of <I>FastCGI</I> no longer
      require the <TT>sfio</TT> library, so this will be dropped from the
      Perl configuration effective with 5.005_03.
    </P>
    <P>
      The immediate benefits to be had from this step include:
      <UL>
        <LI>
          The <TT>sfio</TT> library can be obsoleted, meaning one less
          component to track.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          The build and configuration of Perl is simplified, as the support
          for <TT>sfio</TT> required changing some of the default answers in
          the configuration process.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Additionally, use of the library required that one of the core
          extensions (the <TT>IO</TT> module) be linked statically. It
          also interfered with linking some other extensions and in-house
          code due to the experimental nature of the PerlIO abstraction
          layer that enables use of Sfio.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Most significantly, the linkage of <TT>sfio</TT> caused Perl versions
          higher than 5.004_04 (including 5.004_05, as well as the 5.005 line)
          to fail some of the regression test suite. The specific problem
          also manifests on other (non-HP) systems that built Perl with Sfio.
        </LI>
      </UL>
      Because of the scale of Perl installation across ATG-supported hosts,
      backing out Sfio was not a viable option prior to the upgrade to
      5.005_03.
    </P>
    <H2><A NAME="plan">3. Steps and Approach to Deployment</A></H2>
    <P>
      The effect of upgrading from 5.004_04 to 5.005_03 should be very
      minimal, if felt at all. Changes to the core language were primarily
      the fixing of bugs and the addition of native threads on those systems
      whose kernel supports threading. Still, it is not advisable to simply
      make the upgrade without extensive tests and a clear recovery plan.
    </P>
    <P>
      At present, the installation of Perl is already engineered towards the
      goal of easing installation (and de-installation) of new versions.
      While developers reference the Perl interpreter as
      <TT>/opt/ims/perl5/bin/perl</TT>, the currently-installed base is
      actually housed under the directory <TT>/opt/ims/perl5.004.sfio</TT>.
      <TT>/opt/ims/perl5</TT> is a symbolic link to this. Many of the current
      installations still have <TT>/opt/ims/perl5</TT> compiled in as the
      root of the hierarchy. This will need to be addressed, as well. When
      the 5.005_03 package is built, it will use <TT>/opt/ims/perl5.005</TT>
      as a root (note lack of "<TT>sfio</TT>" in the path). This will not
      only ease installation around issues of in-memory binaries, but will
      allow the old Perl installation to be left in place until ATG is
      satisfied that the transition is complete. Merely changing the value
      of the symbolic link <TT>/opt/ims/perl5</TT> selects between the two.
    </P>
    <P>
      With the assumption that the packages for 5.005_03 (and retro-fit
      packages for 5.004_04 configured to use a more explicit root path)
      can be easily built and bundled, ATG need only identify a build host
      for each hardware/OS permutation that will require support.
    </P>

            included in a distribution bundle (including local modules).

            permutations and move them to the repository. These bundles
            must include all components listed above, even those such as
            <TT><B>DBD::Oracle</B></TT> that may not actually be used on
            the target machine. This is more maintainable than having
            bundles with different sets of modules.

      Once this is done, it will be necessary to enter a period of testing
      (length to be determined) for the evaluation of individual project's
      Perl programs and any possible effects from the upgrade. Because of
      the portable nature of Perl, it should be sufficient to select just
      one machine for this (possibly a second machine from the stage group
      of servers, as well). The selected machine will have the symbolic link
      switched over from 5.004_04 to 5.005_03. Individual projects will then
      be responsible for testing their Perl application under the new
      interpreter.

      Once the testing has been deemed satisfactory, all that will remain will
      be deployment to the full range of ATG-supported machines. Once done,
      it is recommended that the machines retain the 5.004_04 installation for
      at least one month after deployment of 5.005_03, in case of critical
      failure.

      This plan only provides for the deployment of 5.005 and the phasing
      out of 5.004. It is highly recommended that an ongoing maintenance plan
      also be developed to manage the eventual upgrades of the various CPAN
      and in-house modules. As well, Perl itself will inevitably mature to a
      version 5.006, at which time this plan should serve as effectively for
      that migration.
