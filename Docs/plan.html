    <P>
      The <B>Release Manager</B> project as a whole consists of the following
      individual components:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>Server Release Manager Tools</LI>
      <LI>Client Development Tools</LI>
      <LI>Application Programming Interface and Common Code Library</LI>
      <LI>Oracle RDBMS table specifications and data</LI>
      <LI>Supplementary documentation in addition to component documents</LI>
    </UL>
    <P>
      The status as of May 5 is as follows:
    </P>
    <ul>
      <DL>
        <DT><I>Server components</I></DT>
        <DD>
          This package is considered complete and stable. As new features
          are suggested, they are put onto a list. No further development is
          underway at this point, waiting instead for the completion of the
          other parts of the system.
        </DD>
        <DT><I>Client components</I></DT>
        <DD>
          This package may be further divided into three parts: the CVS
          commands wrapper, the tools used by content developers for
          packaging et al, and the translation wrapper used internally by
          CVS to manage the tokenization and token-expansion within text
          files. Of these three, the command wrapper is complete, the
          populate/stage/release tool is finished but awaiting further
          field testing, and the translation wrapper is currently still in
          the design phase.
        </DD>
        <DT><I>Library and API</I></DT>
        <DD>
          The library of common functions and interfaces is also complete to
          the point of use on production machines. The documentation is
          complete, as are all projected API calls for support of both
          client-side and server-side applications. The current version of
          a database editing tool is held here, for now, pending a better
          place to put it.
        </DD>
        <DT><I>RDBMS components</I></DT>
        <DD>
          At present, this is mostly an on-paper placeholder for the knowledge
          base that comprises the database tables and structure. The datastore
          is housed in the Oracle DB <B><TT>IMSPDB1</TT></B>. The data is
          current live in support of the client components. The short-term
          goals for this component include extending the existing database
          tables and adding at least one more. Certain tools, such as a SQL
          script for creating the tables and a Perl/DBI/CGI tool for editing
          the data, will eventually be separated out of the other components
          and used as the core for this component to be a separate entity.
        </DD>
        <DT><I>Additional documentation</I></DT>
        <DD>
          Planned additional material includes all related design documents,
          a progress/status/tasklist page (targetted as HTML), an installation
          and maintenance guide, and process documentation. This is planned
          in addition to the per-tool documentation that will be packaged with
          each individual component. This will be one of the last pieces
          developed, to ensure that the documents accurately reflect the
          functionality of the system.

    <H2><A NAME="dependancies">2. Inter-Component Dependancies</A></H2>
    <P>
      The following diagram illustrates the dependancies between parts of
      the release management system. In this diagram, an arrow points from a
      component with a dependancy to the component that is depended upon:
    </P>
    <DIV ALIGN="center">
      <IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="dep-diag.gif" WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=480 ALT="Dependancy Diagram">
    </DIV>
    <P>
      In the diagram, it is shown that the database elements of the system
      are the the closest to a bottleneck in terms of any impact that changes
      would have on the remaining pieces. Also note that the documentation
      elements are not shown as having any direct dependancy on the
      library/API or the database.

      This table outlines the development track for the <B>Release Manager</B>
      as a project. Each column is self-explanatory, save for the
      <B><I>S</I></B> column which refers to the sequence number of each
      component. This is to illustrate the parallel nature of the client-
      and server-side components.

            The remaining library call in the Lib/API component does not
            affect this component (though it will be used here, in the planned
            next generation). This has been in stable deployment for over 6
            months. No new work is expected until after the initial stable
            deployment of the entire system as a whole, including the
            development of the supplemental documentation.

          <TD>70%</TD>
          <TD>
            There are three primary branches of this component: a
            <I>CVS Command Wrapper</I>, the <I>Developer Management Tools</I>
            and the <I>Path/URL Translation Engine</I>. Of these
            three:
            <DL>
              <DT><B>CVS Command Wrapper</B></DT>
              <DD>
                Complete.
              </DD>
              <DT><B>Developer Management Tools</B></DT>
              <DD>
                <FONT COLOR=red>95% Complete</FONT>.
                The coding is complete. The FTP support is written and
		fit into the tool, but still needs testing.
              </DD>
              <DT><B>Path/URL Translator</B></DT>
              <DD>
                <FONT COLOR=red>Not started</FONT>.
                Certain points regarding the design are still being
                finalized. The existing wrapper is functional, though slow
                and difficult to maintain. Work will commence after that
                last parts are done on the <TT>release</TT> tool. Given
                that, a rough estimate places this at
                <FONT COLOR=red>2 weeks to develop</FONT> and
                <FONT COLOR=red>1 week for testing</FONT>.
              </DD>
            </DL>
            <br>
            Besides these, there is a requirement for a command-line to that
            would allow batch-mode release of small numbers of files, to
            assist projects that use nightly jobs to generate semi-static
            content from databases. This tool is still under consideration.

          <TD>
            Not started. Requires completion of both Server Side and Client
            Side. Current estimate is for
            <FONT COLOR=red>two documents</FONT>, tentative topics
            of "System Setup and Administration" and "User Manual and
            Process Guide". Approximately
            <FONT COLOR=red>one week for development of initial draft of each (two weeks total)</FONT>.
            An additional
            <FONT COLOR=red>4-5 days for gathering of proofreading feedback and making corrections and clarifications</FONT>
            is also expected.
            The first document completed can overlay the majority of
            proofreading with the development of the second document. All
            told, expect this component to need
            <FONT COLOR=red>3-4 weeks, or simply one month, to complete</FONT>.
