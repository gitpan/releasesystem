<h1>
Release Management System: Development Manager Component</h1></center>

<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="overview"></a>1. Overview</h2>
The scope of this document is limited to those tools that make up the developer
side of the <b>Release Management System</b>. By definition, these are
the tools that are used directly by the developers on a project (be they
applications engineers or content developers). These tools are installed
on each of the machines designated as development hosts. The primary goal
of the suite of developer tools is to provide enhanced <tt>CVS</tt> functionality,
tools (commands) to perform management of files for release, and lastly,
a "wrapper" utility activated directly by the <tt>CVS</tt> tools that performs
a series of pathname and <tt>URI</tt> translations on files during check-out
and commit operations.
<p>Throughout this document, the following names are used to refer to the
three distinct sub-parts of the <b>Development Manager</b>:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>front-end</b></dt>

<dd>
The encapsulator for the <tt>CVS</tt> commands</dd>

<dt>
<b>release tool</b></dt>

<dd>
The tool responsible for managing the larger aspects of file management
and releases</dd>

<dt>
<b>wrapper</b></dt>

<dd>
The utility invoked directly by <tt>CVS</tt> to manage path and <tt>URI</tt>
translations.</dd>
</dl>
This is not intended to be a line-by-line dissection of the tools. Where
it will help, specific variables, parameters or subroutines will be referenced.
But overall, the primary intent is to focus more on <i>why</i> the tools
do what they do, without as much emphasis on <i>how</i> it is done (except
where it contributes to the former).
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="design"></a>2. General Design Principle</h2>
The elements of the <b>Development Manager</b> package follow the same
design philosophy as the <b>Release Management System</b> as a whole. The
basic premise is that each of the individual components should be maintainable
and upgradable independent of the others. Provided a common interface layer
is maintained, the internal implementation of that interface should not
be of concern to other tools, or to other top-level components. This will
be a recurring theme throughout the explanation of the individual scripts
and their methods of interaction.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="frontend"></a>3. The <tt>cvs_front_end</tt> script</h2>
The first of the tools to be covered is the script that encapsulates the
various <tt>CVS</tt> actions, allowing for site-specific configuration
to be added to all such invocations. This script is called <b><tt>cvs_front_end</tt></b>,
though it is very rarely invoked under that name. The script is designed
to be the target of several symbolic links, and the behavior is dictated
by which name is used to call the tool itself. For many of the <tt>CVS</tt>
operations, the use of the encapsulating tool merely provides a sort of
"shorthand" calling convention, freeing the end-users the need to start
each of the commands with the "<tt>cvs</tt>" prefix.
<h3>
3.1. Pass-through invocations</h3>
The following invocations of the front-end tool are simply convenience
functions for the sake of the end-user. Each of these passes control directly
to the underlying <tt>CVS</tt> binary, without any changes to the parameters:
<ul>
<li>
update</li>

<li>
add</li>

<li>
remove</li>

<li>
status</li>

<li>
tag</li>

<li>
cdiff (performs "<tt>cvs diff</tt>")</li>

<li>
clog (performs "<tt>cvs log</tt>")</li>
</ul>

<h3>
3.2. The <tt>checkout</tt> invocation</h3>
The only special operation performed by this invocation is changing into
the user's <b><tt>public_html</tt></b> directory (in their home directory)
prior to executing the <tt>cvs checkout</tt> command. It currently has
as an unfortunate (and undesirable) side-effect in that the automatic changing
of directory prevents the user from checking out project sub-directories
from within the project directory hierarchy.
<p>Once the checkout is complete (assuming there were no errors), the tool
checks for the presence of a file named "<b><tt>Makefile</tt></b>" in the
root directory of the project. If such a file exists, then the tool changes
to the root directory of the project and executes the command, "<tt>make
checkout</tt>". If the <tt>make</tt> utility reports that no such target
exists, that error is silently ignored. Any other errors are reported.
For more on this functionality, see the section titled <a href="#makehooks">Make
Hooks</a> below.
<p><font size=-1>Note: Upon examination of the make-hook code in this case,
I think that it may not currently work correctly. This needs closer scrutiny
and some degree of unit testing.</font>
<h3>
3.3. The <tt>finish</tt> invocation</h3>
This calling method is provided to perform the tasks of the <tt>CVS</tt>
command, "<b><tt>cvs release -d</tt></b>". When invoked on a specified
project, it will first warn the user that a check for modified files is
being performed in the workspace. The results of the search are presented
to the user, who is then asked to confirm their desire to cease work in
the given workspace and authorize its removal. Note that this does not
remove files from the <tt>CVS</tt> repository itself, nor even mark files
to be moved to the "attic" (a concept used by <tt>CVS</tt> to denote files
that are considered deleted, but retained for possible legacy needs).
<p>Answering in the affirmative will completely remove the specified workspace
(project) from the user's working area, even if there are uncommitted changes
pending.
<h3>
3.4. The <tt>import</tt> and <tt>new</tt> invocations</h3>
These two are structured in very similar terms, differing only in the underlying
<tt>CVS</tt> command that control is passed to. Each checks the repository
to ensure that the project (internal or third-party) name is not currently
in use. If not, then control is passed to the relevant <tt>CVS</tt> command.
If the name is in use, an error is reported to the user.
<h3>
3.5. The <tt>xnew</tt> invocation</h3>
This calling context is an extension to the existing <tt>CVS</tt> suite
for the sake of specific needs within the development environment. The
specific problem that this invocation solves is the case in which a third-party
source tree is maintained using the internal development and release process,
but is subject to update from the originating party. In simpler terms,
the project specified when this tool is called is treated as a third-part
project that is assumed to already exist in the repository. The contents
of the repository are updated to reflect the user's workspace, and the
new set of revisions tagged with a specified symbol. This greatly simplifies
the process of integrating third-party updates.
<h3>
3.6. The <tt>commit</tt> invocation</h3>
Lastly, there is the encapsulation of the <tt>CVS</tt> "commit" operation,
which is the basic means by which changes are made to the repository itself.
While the basic commit operation is not altered, it is at this point in
the process flow that functionality was inserted to ensure that the permissions
on the user's workspace are kept consistent. Because of the "helpful" nature
of <tt>CVS</tt> and <tt>RCS</tt> in terms of setting file access permissions,
the tool performs a quick check on the permissions of the files within
the user's workspace prior to performing the actual commit. Since discrepancies
in access permissions are most likely to affect an attempted commit operation,
this seemed the logical place to insert these tests.
<h3>
3.7. General to most invocations</h3>
Several of the invocations (specifically, those that govern the extraction
of versioned files from the repository) pass information along to the <i>wrapper</i>
component of the development system by means of an environment variable
called <b><tt>WM_CONTROL</tt></b> (the "WM" is a historical reference to
the team's original charter as simply a web-master team). The new generation
of the front-end component currently retains this interface until such
time as the wrapper component is re-engineered.
<h3>
3.8. Calling the script by the base name</h3>
As was said at the start of this section, the <tt>cvs_front_end</tt> script
is rarely called by that name. The calling of the script under the base
name is part of the installation process. When called in this fashion,
the script creates symbolic links in the same directory as that which the
script resides in. Each of the commands listed above is created as a link
in this fashion. At present, there is a boolean-style variable declared
early in the application called <b><tt>$TESTING</tt></b>. If this variable
has any non-null value, then all commands are also given the numeral "2"
at the end of the names. This is to allow for the original tools to co-exist
with the new tools until such time as the new tools can completely replace
the older set of tools.
<p>Performing this task should be considered a part of setting up any host
as a development platform. The current architecture of these tools on hosts
such as <b>webdev</b> also involves a <i>setuid wrapper</i>, a tool written
in a lower-level language (in this case, the <tt>C</tt> programming language)
that performs certain security-related checks and then executes the intended
program under a different user ID than that of the person running the command.
This is necessary for the sake of permissions on the <tt>CVS</tt> repository.
The management of this security application and the means by which it maps
to the Perl scripts is not directly part of the <b>Release Manager</b>,
and thus not discussed here.
<hr>
<h2>
<a NAME="release"></a>4. The <tt>dev_rls_tool</tt> script</h2>
This is a much more complex tool than the wrapper just described. Though
there are few means of invocation, the actions performed and the depth
of detail demand greater attention.
<p>The functions performed by this tool are those vital to the core design
of the <b>Release Manager</b>: this tool keeps the development <tt>HTTP</tt>
document area up to date, creates and maintains the staging areas in preparation
for release to external servers, and most importantly of all, bundles and
transmits the data that comprises a new release of a given project. As
with the front-end tool, this is accomplished by one Perl application that
uses symbolic links in order to be called under different names. This tool
is invoked as:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>dev_rls_tool</b></dt>

<dd>
As with the previous tool, this application uses an invocation by the native
name to perform various installation and maintenance actions.</dd>

<dt>
<b>populate</b></dt>

<dd>
A <i>populate</i> operation is one in which the system's <tt>HTTP</tt>
document tree is brought up-to-date with regards to the <tt>CVS</tt> repository.
It is during this stage that certain control files (defined and documented
below) are also brought up-to-date.</dd>

<dt>
<b>stage</b></dt>

<dd>
This action is used to create or update the <i>staging</i> area for a particular
project being released to a particular host. It is during this step that
file paths and <tt>URI</tt> references are translated based on a set of
rules that define the target host's server environment. This step utilizes
the control files maintained by the <i>populate</i> step, and updates some
of its own in preparation for the actual release of the project.</dd>

<dt>
<b>release</b></dt>

<dd>
This last invocation is the form of the tool that actually analyzes a project
area for changed content, creates a bundle of those files that have changed,
and transmits the changes to the remote server host.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>
4.1. The maintenance invocation: <tt>dev_rls_tool</tt></h3>
As with the above tool, the maintenance function of this tool is to create
the symbolic links by which the tool is also known. The names for the <i>populate</i>,
<i>stage</i> and <i>release</i> invocations are declared towards the top
of the script, where they are easily identified. They are expressed this
way so as to simplify switching between the "normal" names, and the currently-used
practice of appending the numeral "2" to the ends, so as to allow co-existence
with the legacy tools. When the time comes for these tools to completely
supersede the older tools, the numbering can be removed from the names.
<h3>
4.2. The <tt>populate</tt> invocation</h3>

<h3>
4.3. The <tt>stage</tt> invocation</h3>

<h3>
4.4. The <tt>release</tt> invocation</h3>

<h2>
<a NAME="wrapper"></a>5. Some thoughts on the wrapper utility</h2>
Though a new-generation <tt>CVS</tt> wrapper has not yet been designed
or developed, there are some matters that may help to consider:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>CVS</tt> invokes the utility on one file at a time, for each file designated
to be handled by the wrapper.</li>

<li>
The same tool <i>does not</i> have to be used for commits into the repository
as is used for check-outs from the repository. However, since the logic
is fundamentally the same for both operations, it has made sense from a
simplicity and maintenance point to have just the one tool.</li>

<li>
The current tool has all the host-specific data expressed in-line as an
extremely large data structure. In the past, roughly 90% of the errors
associated with adding a new external host as a supported system were related
to updates of this data structure. While the new method uses Oracle database
tables, not all the data needed by the wrapper is in the current tables
(necessitating expansion of the tables or design of new tables to accompany
them). Additionally, the overhead of accessing Oracle on every invocation
(particularly when one considers that large runs of successive invocations
will be for one given host) may well be worse than the overhead for parsing
the data structure each time.</li>

<li>
The use of these types of wrappers is no longer supported by the maintainers
of <tt>CVS</tt>. The 1.10 version currently in use was fetched from a third-party
site where users had re-enabled the functionality in the 1.10 source base.
Use of the wrappers cannot co-exist with the <tt>CVS</tt> client/server
model. Future releases of <tt>CVS</tt> won't have wrappers, and the third
party cannot be counted on to continue re-implementing this.</li>

<li>
The primary motivation for the wrappers is the legacy need for translating
the <tt>URI</tt>s of <tt>CGI</tt> applications. When the primary (and practiacally
only) machine was the host <tt>www.interactive.hp.com</tt>, all projects
shared a common CGI directory. To avoid name clashes, projects fanned out
from this point by project name. A <tt>URI</tt> of the form "<tt>/project/cgi-bin/app_name</tt>",
as it was known on the development machine, became "<tt>/cgi-bin/project/app_name</tt>"
on delivery. This required support at the <tt>CVS</tt> level, to re-write
these <tt>URI</tt>s dynamically. If this need can be eliminated, the wrappers
may be, as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="config"></a>6. The <tt>dev_release.cfg</tt> file</h2>
There are a variety of parameters that govern parts of the system's overall
functionality. These lend themselves to centralization in one file both
for the sake of sharing between applications and so that these values can
change independent of the actual program files. The applications look for
the configuration file by examining their own fully-qualified path within
the file system, dropping the last element of the path and then appending
"<tt>local</tt>". This is based on an assumption that the trailing element
of executables used in this system is "<tt>ahp-bin</tt>". Additionally,
to accommodate the suid-wrapper/symlink issue described earlier, the path
component "<tt>suid_scripts</tt>" is also checked for. If present, it is
simply discarded. In this directory, the file named <tt>dev_release.cfg</tt>
is expected to exist and contain the settings.
<p>The structure and format of the file is a simple sequence of lines of
the form:
<center><tt>NAME = VALUE</tt></center>
This should be obvious enough in style and intent. The amount of empty
space surrounding the equal sign is flexible. From the first non-whitespace
character to the right of the equal sign to the end of the current line
is all encompassed at the value of the parameter. This allows for parameters
with spaces within them. However, extra space <i>after</i> the last non-whitespace
character is removed. As an additional feature, lines may optionally start
with either of the special words, <tt>setenv</tt> or <tt>export</tt>. These
keywords are used by the C-shell and Korn shell, respectively, to set environment
variables. (The Bourne shell and "Bourne-Again" shell <tt>bash</tt> also
use <tt>export</tt> for environment variables.) To date, the flexibility
has not been needed, but it adds negligible overhead or complexity to the
tool, and leaves the option of future application open. Lastly, blank lines
are permitted for the sake of readability, and lines whose first character
is "<tt>#</tt>" are considered commentary and ignored.
<p>The values currently stored in the file, and their definitions, are:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>ACL_DIR</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>etc/acl</tt></dd>

<br>The directory in which the access-control lists (<tt>ACL</tt>) are
stored on a per-host basis. These files are described in more detail elsewhere,
but the short definition is that they govern which projects can release
to a specific target host, and which users are entitled to release a given
project. If the value is not an absolute path, it is considered relative
to the home directory of the <b><tt>USER</tt></b> defined below.
<dt>
<b>CVS</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>/opt/ims/bin/cvs</tt></dd>

<br>This is the fully-qualified path to the executable <tt>cvs</tt> program.
Specifying it here accomplishes two important goals: (1) the programs are
not reliant on the running user to have the correct directories in their
execution path, and (2) the danger of the tools being compromised by placement
of a dangerous program named <tt>cvs</tt> in an alternate element of the
execution path is eliminated. It also allows for the explicit selection
of a binary to use, a feature that was utilized when evaluating version
1.10 of <tt>CVS</tt>.
<dt>
<b>CVSROOT</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>/opt/ims/repository</tt></dd>

<br>The <tt>cvs</tt> command relies on either a command-line specification
of a repository root, or for the value to be defined in an environment
variable named <b><tt>CVSROOT</tt></b>. Defining it here not only guarantees
consistency, but also prevents errors or data loss due to an incorrectly-set
value on the user end.
<dt>
<b>DEVHOST</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>webdev.nafohq.hp.com</tt></dd>

<br>The fully-qualified-domain name of the development host the tools are
running on. This is not currently used to any real extent, but was planned
for use by the <i>wrapper</i> component.
<dt>
<b>EVENT_LOG</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>/opt/ims/htdocs/development-log.txt</tt></dd>

<br>Many of the actions performed by the tools are check-pointed by an
entry written to this log as a single line. Not all tools are making maximum
use of this at present.
<dt>
<b>FTP</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>/opt/ims/bin/ftp</tt></dd>

<br>This is the full path to the <tt>ftp</tt> binary, defined for the same
reasons as the <tt>cvs</tt> binary. Additionally, this serves the purpose
of ensuring that the program used has been built with correct network library
code to allow it to pass through the firewall.
<dt>
<b>GROUP</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>idsweb</tt></dd>

<br>When files are created or updated in the project root or staging areas,
this value (which may also be expressed numerically) is used to set the
group ownership on such files and the directories that contain them.
<dt>
<b>HALTFILE_PREFIX</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>etc/halt-</tt></dd>

<br>This prefix is used when checking for "halt files" pertaining to the
command about to be run. Halt files are explained earlier. If the value
is not an absolute path, it is considered relative to the home directory
of the <b><tt>USER</tt></b> defined below.
<dt>
<b>HTTP_PROXY</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>http://web-proxy:8088</tt></dd>

<br>When the new-generation tools were being designed, <tt>HTTP</tt> file
upload was favored over <tt>FTP</tt>-based transmission, since the password
and user name were of less consequence if compromised. Due to limitations
related to the <tt>HTTP</tt>-based solution, this is gradually being phased
out and the original <tt>FTP</tt>-based approach is now preferred. This
parameter is used to define a proxy for the <tt>HTTP</tt> approach, if
one is needed. Without it, transfers beyond a firewall would not be possible.
<dt>
<b>OWNER</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>idsweb</tt></dd>

<br>This user name (or numeric ID if expressed as such) is used for several
purposes: it is the ownership assigned to files both in the <tt>CVS</tt>
repository and the staging areas, and it is the source for a home directory
to use as a base directory for the values <b><tt>HALTFILE_PREFIX</tt></b>
and <b><tt>ACL_DIR</tt></b>. It is also this user that is permitted to
override certain safeguards such as access-control lists and halt files.
<dt>
<b>PROJECT_ROOT</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>/opt/ims/htdocs</tt></dd>

<br>This is the area in which the developmental versions of project hierarchies
are kept. This is the designated document root for the server instance
that runs on the development host, and each project is kept in its own
unique directory under this root.
<dt>
<b>RELEASE</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>.release</tt></dd>

<br>The file which the <i>release</i>-specific tool updates to mark a successful
release. It is expected to be a simple file, not a path, and will be created/updated
in the project's directory under <b><tt>PROJECT_ROOT</tt></b>.
<dt>
<b>STAGE_ROOT</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>/opt/ims/staging</tt></dd>

<br>When a project is being staged in preparation for release to a different
host, the project directory is under this directory as its root. As explained
earlier, this directory fans out into a set of directories named for the
target external hosts, and the projects are staged under these host-specific
directories on a per-request basis. This allows for projects to be staged
to multiple hosts (i.e. a testing and a production machine) without concern
for conflicts in the staging area.
<dt>
<b>TAR</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>/opt/ims/bin/tar</tt></dd>

<br>See the entries for <b><tt>CVS</tt></b> and <b><tt>FTP</tt></b>. The
added benefit for this specification is in guaranteeing that the selected
binary supports on-the-fly compression and decompression of archive files
(as the <tt>GNU tar</tt> implementation does).
<dt>
<b>TOPICLIST</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>.topiclist</tt></dd>

<br>This is one of the files updated by the <i>populate</i>-specific tool
and referenced by the <i>stage</i> tool. The information in it is not generally
used in guiding the software, but rather for noting informational aspects
of the project.
<dt>
<b>WEBLIST</b></dt>

<dd>
Default: <tt>.weblist</tt></dd>

<br>Lastly, this file is the basis for the management of the files that
comprise a project. It is updated by the <i>populate</i> tool and referenced
by the <i>stage</i> tool. It is explained in greater detail elsewhere.
As with <b><tt>RELEASE</tt></b> and <b><tt>TOPICLIST</tt></b>, it should
have no path component, and will be created and updated in the project's
area under <b><tt>PROJECT_ROOT</tt></b>.</dl>

<h2>
<a NAME="intertool"></a>7. Inter-tool Communication</h2>
As was referred to in the section on the <a href="#frontend"><tt>CVS</tt>
front-end</a>, there are times when tools have to pass information between
them that can't be passed on the command line. In general, this is limited
to passing information from the <i>front-end</i> component to the <i>wrapper</i>
component. This is done by means of an environment variable called <b><tt>WM_CONTROL</tt></b>.
The front-end function sets this variable with one or more words that describe
the action currently in progress. The wrapper then knows whether the operation
is going into the repository, coming out from the repository, etc. It can
also then tell which specific host is the target of actions like <i>stage</i>.
Since the wrapper is not called directly by the tools (but rather by the
actual <tt>cvs</tt> binary), this is the only feasible way of passing this
information.
<p>Since the necessary context is apparent from the command-line of the
front-end tool, the tool that handles population, staging, etc. does not
use this. By calling the front-end versions of <tt>CVS</tt> commands, the
information is already present.
